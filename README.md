# 👋 Hi there, I'm Mai Mahmoud!

🎓 I'm currently a B.Tech student at CIC College, passionate about front-end development and creating clean, user-friendly web interfaces.

💻 I enjoy building projects with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I'm currently diving deeper into **React** and modern web development practices.

🌱 I'm on a journey to grow as a developer — from hands-on projects to learning UI/UX principles and building full-stack apps.

🔧 Technologies I use:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- React (with Vite), Git & GitHub
- APIs, JSON, Responsive Design

📌 Projects I'm proud of:
- An e-commerce styled site inspired by **SHEIN**
- A React form app with live input preview & data table
- Responsive designs using manual media queries

✨ I'm also passionate about personal growth, self-discovery, and expressing my authentic self through both code and creativity.
